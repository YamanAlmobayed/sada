# SADA

SADA is a comprehensive backend system developed using Django and Django Rest Framework, specifically designed to cater to the needs of children with Cerebral Palsy. The platform incorporates a user-friendly interface and provides three distinct account types: Admin, Doctor, and Parent. Each account type has unique functionalities aimed at facilitating efficient management and monitoring of children with cerebral palsy.

## Account Types

- **Admin Account:** 

        1- Admin accounts are granted full control and authority over the system.
        2- They can manage user accounts, including creating, updating, and deleting them.
        3- Admins have the capability to oversee all aspects of the system, ensuring smooth operation.

- **Doctor Account:** 

        1- Doctors, with their specialized role, can perform various essential tasks.
        2- They have the ability to add children and link them to their respective parents.

        4- Additionally, doctors are equipped to conduct tests on children. The system provides four types of tests: Portage test, Wechsler test, 9 LDDRS tests, and an Early Parent General Test.

- **Parent Account:**

        1- Parents are granted access to monitor and check the current state of their child.
